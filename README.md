# Google-Foobar
Foobar is a semi-secret hiring challenge Google put out there to find talented developers via somewhat unconventional yet fitting means. Foobar is a series of five levels of algorithmic questions of ever-increasing difficulty and allotted time to solve these questions.

# This challenge has 5-Levels.
First 3 levels are easy as questions are asked from DFS, BFS, number theory or simple DP **whereas** Level-4 & Level-5 can be challenging you with Graphs, combinatorics, bitmask DP. In my case (when i was invited for first time)  the last two level questions were from combinatorics & mostly mathematical field..permutations, Group theory etc.

# How to give Google Foobar Challenge?
There's no option to manually apply for **Foobar Challenge**, If you are likely to be worthy So challenge itself will come to you.

# The secret
If you continuously search topics related to programming in chrome browser, So after some time you can see an invitation that says "You're speaking our language, Up for a challenge?"
You just have to click on "I want to play" Button to enter the **Foobar Challenge**.

# Can we get hired for any role in Google after completing all the 5-Levels?
Ummm....I would say NO probably.
Earlier (when it was launched) people who had completed all the 5-Levels, They were asked for their details  & said a recruiter would call you and many of them even got call from recruiter for an INTERVIEW.

**BUT** now, Although they still ask for details to be filled for a recruiter to reach you **BUT** probably no one gets call for an INTERVIEW or something.
